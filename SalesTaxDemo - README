# Csharp-Programming
COP 2360
Create a program named SalesTaxDemo that declares an array of 10 Sale objects. Prompt the user for data for each object and display the 10 objects. The program should accept input and display output in the same format as the sample program output below.

Data fields for Sale objects include:

InventoryNumber - An inventory number (as a string)
amount - Amount of the sale (as a double)
tax - Tax owed (as a double)
Include a property with get and set accessors for the first two data fields, but make the tax owed a read-only property.

The tax should be calculated whenever the amount of the sale is set. Assume that the tax rate is 8 percent for the first $100 and 6 percent for any amount greater than $100.
